# DFS AIP Web Interface

A self-hosted web UI around the [DFS AIP](https://github.com/hamarituc/dfs-aip) tool, which
downloads and print-prepares the German DFS Aeronautical Information Publication (basicAIP /
VFR) as PDFs.

The UI lets you manage download profiles, schedule nightly updates, trigger updates manually,
browse run history, and download the generated (OCR'd) PDFs — all from the browser.

## Quick start

Run the published images from the GitHub Container Registry — no build needed:

```sh
docker compose up -d
# then open http://localhost:8080
```

This uses the [`docker-compose.yaml`](docker-compose.yaml) in the project root, which pulls
`ghcr.io/freezemanny/dfs-aip-frontend` and `ghcr.io/freezemanny/dfs-aip-backend`:

```yaml
services:
  frontend:
    image: ghcr.io/freezemanny/dfs-aip-frontend:latest
    container_name: dfs-aip-frontend
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    depends_on:
      - backend
    restart: unless-stopped

  backend:
    image: ghcr.io/freezemanny/dfs-aip-backend:latest
    container_name: dfs-aip-backend
    environment:
      # Auto-update configuration
      - AUTO_UPDATE_ENABLED=true
      - AUTO_UPDATE_HOUR=2    # 2 AM (24-hour format)
      - AUTO_UPDATE_MINUTE=0  # 00 minutes
    volumes:
      - data:/app/data      # Profiles JSON
      - output:/app/output  # Generated PDFs
      - aip-cache:/app/cache  # Cache
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  data:
  output:
  aip-cache:
```

To build the images locally from source instead:

```sh
docker compose -f webui/docker-compose.yaml up --build -d
```

See [`webui/README.md`](webui/README.md) for configuration, environment variables, and the API.

## Contributing

Every PR is **squash-merged**, and the squash commit message is the **PR title**. That single
title is therefore the only string release-please ever reads, and the only one that has to be
a [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) — the **PR Title** check enforces
it. Commits *inside* your branch are yours: `wip`, `fixup`, `asdf`, whatever helps you save
work. None of them reach `main` or the changelog, so there is no commit-message hook to install.

Title format:

```
<type>(<optional scope>): <description>
```

Allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`,
`chore`, `revert`. Append `!` for a breaking change (e.g. `feat!:`). Because the squash body is
the **PR description**, that is also where a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer goes. Examples:

```
feat(frontend): add run-history filter
fix(backend): handle empty profile list
chore(deps): bump vite
```

> Only `feat`, `fix`, and breaking changes bump a version; the rest don't trigger a release. The
> scope decides *which* component gets released — release-please assigns a change to `backend` or
> `frontend` by the paths it touches, and each gets its own version, changelog, tag and image tag.
>
> A PR that does two unrelated things collapses into one changelog entry under one type. The fix
> is to split the PR.

The other checks on a PR: **backend** (byte-compile + build the backend image) and **frontend**
(eslint, `tsc`, Vite build + build the frontend image). Both build the images that actually ship,
without pushing them, so a bad dependency or base-image bump fails here rather than at release
time.
